1.Cloud Front: maintaining static data in cache servers. CDN. creating distributions in different Az. the user requests will not directly goto central servers, it first fetching from nearest edgelocations. 
  > cost reduced
  > low latency 
  > less data transfering rate.
  > high availability
  > security
  
Practical: create s3 bucket static webhosting and this use as domain and create distribution. will get Distribution URL. it will work as edgelocation accessed over the internet. 

2.VPC peering in diff region through windows:
practical: create vpc with subnet2 in one region. create another and create only one private subnet.
  > goto routes and associate.
  > public ip has publicip
  > vpc peering
  > define peering routes in Editroutes
  > Connect through RDP client

3. Lambda Functions: lambda functions are supports serverless archetecture. it can be triggered with any other services in the AWS. main intesion of this is
  > Security compliance: we can restrict the previleges and govern the ac through cloud watch alarms and notifications.
  > Cost Optimization : find and remove stale resources

  create a lambdafunction use functional URL for accesing external world.
  Prctical:
   usecase:
   > create lambdafunction deploy and test. use FURL. 
   > create lambdafunction copy paste gitcode from abhishek day17, attach customer policies(snapshot and instance). create EC2 create snapshot. deploy and run. 
   > remove EC2 and run. automatically remove snaps
